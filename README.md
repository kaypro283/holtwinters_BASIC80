# holtwinters_BASIC80
A comprehensive Holt-Winters exponential smoothing forecasting engine written entirely in structured BASIC. This program supports both additive and multiplicative seasonal models, automatic seasonality detection using the autocorrelation function (ACF), brute-force optimization of smoothing parameters (alpha, beta, gamma), and detailed statistical diagnostics. It computes forecasts with prediction intervals, evaluates model accuracy with multiple error metrics (MPE, MAPE, MAE, RMSE), and performs residual analysis using the Durbin-Watson statistic and Ljung-Box Q test.
